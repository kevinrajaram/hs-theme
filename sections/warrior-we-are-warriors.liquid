      <h2>FALL DOWN SEVEN TIMES, GET UP EIGHT</h2>
      <p>During my fighting career I went to war with many opponentsâ€¦But my biggest opponent has always been me.</p>

      <p>Still to this day I am at war with myself in order to become the greatest version of me that I can be. This to me is what a true Warrior will do.</p>
      
      <p>I also believe that in life a Warrior must constantly be learning, and what I have learned from Dr. Paul Saladino has enabled me to fight in my life much harder. <strong>Since I began eating organs I feel stronger, I have more energy and I am healthier.</strong></p>
